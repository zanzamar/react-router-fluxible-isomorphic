				<p>My website is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.</p>
				<p>My website, without me, is useless. Without my website, I am useless. I must program my website true. I must test better than my competition who is competing with me. I must deploy him before he deploys. I will...</p>
				<p>My website and I know that what counts on the internet is not the content we deploy, the markup on the page, nor the user interface. We know that it is the users that count. We will get users...</p>
				<p>My website is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its environment and its source code. I will keep my website optimized and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...</p>
				<p>Before Cthulhu, I swear this creed. My website and I are the defenders of the internet. We are the masters of our competition. We are the saviors of my life.</p>
